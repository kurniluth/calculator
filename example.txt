Abraham Lincoln loved cats. He had four of them while he lived in the White House.
The name "jaguar" comes from a Native American word meaning "he who kills with one leap".
The cat's clavicle, or collarbone, does not connect with other bones but is buried in the muscles of the shoulder region. This lack of a functioning collarbone allows them to fit through any opening the size of their head.
